c Hi Stefan,
c honestly I don't see a sense in these decompositions; for us its not the
c computation that's the problem, but the generality of the parameter.
c so the lambda/gamma maps hyperedges...
c
c
c The difference is, that at each bag, the vertices are not covered by hyperedges,
c but by a "fractional edge cover". This is a mapping of edges to real numbers between 0 and 1
c (let's call this the weight of the edge),
c such that each vertex is covered by edges whose sum of weights is at least 1.
c
c
c For instance, if the hypergraph is a triangle and a bag contains all three vertices,
c then an optimal edge cover would be to assign each edge the weight 0.5.
c The total weight is then 1.5, and this determines the fhw.

c
c TODO define the format for a hypertree decomposition here, what does that actually mean
c This file describes a tree decomposition with 4 bags, width 2, for a graph with 5 vertices
